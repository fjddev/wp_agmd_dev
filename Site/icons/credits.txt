Hover Icons come from the tutorials ( Simple Icon Hover Effects ).

Thanks and credit for the fantastic efforts in animations and design process goes to Mary Lou at

We simply modified the code CSS to better suit the look and feel of the template.

For the icons we are using an icon font (Eco Ico by Matthew Skiles, created with the IcoMoon app) which we add using the :before pseudo-class.
